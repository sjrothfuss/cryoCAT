    "# Masks basics\n",
    "Masks are maps that are used in the alignment operation during subtomogram averaging and classification, where they are part of the required inputs.\n",
    "- Internally, masks are stored as 3D numpy.ndarray objects.\n",
    "- Externally, masks can be loaded from and written as EM and MRC files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Masks can be distinguished in binary masks and masks with smooth edges:\n",
    "- In binary masks, voxels have only 0 and 1 values (e.g. masks from segmentations);\n",
    "- In masks with soft edges, voxels have values from 0 to 1. This can be accomplished applying a Gaussian filter to the mask."
