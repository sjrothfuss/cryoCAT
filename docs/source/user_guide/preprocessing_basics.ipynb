    "# Tiltstack and mdoc modules: Functions for processing tilt-series\n",
    "\n",
    "Tilt-series (TS) represent the raw data available after a session of data collection. Those are accompanied by text files that store metadata, hereby referred as mdoc files, from their file extension. The set of operations that are performed to reconstruct the tomographic volumes from the tilt-series are collectively referred to as preprocessing steps. <br/> \n",
    "First, each projection image (which is collected as set of frames) should be corrected for beam-induced motion with a dedicated software. Each image file that belongs to the same tilt-series is then be combined into a stack that can be further processed to reconstruct the tomographic volume. CryoCAT offers a number of functions for processing the motion-corrected stacks until alignment of the projection images and tomogram reconstruction, for which a number of dedicated software already exist. <br/>\n",
    "The accepted format for tilt-stacks in cryoCAT is MRC. In this section of the user guide, we explain the basic concepts of the Tiltstack and Mdoc objects and then illustrate some of the operations that can be performed on tilt-stacks using cryoCAT and we provide some examples."

    "## Basics\n",
    "Tilt-series and mdoc files are internally stored in the Tiltstack and Mdoc classes, respectively. Please note that most of the functionalities are available outside of these objects, namely functions exist so that one can simply pass the path to the desired file to achieve the desired outcome without initializing the classes, whcih will be done internally. Nonetheless, for completeness we hereby illustrate the basic concepts of those objects and we provide examples for both the use cases, where applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tiltstack basics\n",
    "Internally, tilt-series are stored in the Tiltstack class, which can be initialized passing the path of a tilt-series or passing directly a numpy array. The attributes of a Tiltstack objects are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `data`: 3D numpy array with the actual pixel values;\n",
    "- `data_type`: type of the array elements;\n",
    "- `input_order`: original order of the array dimensions (default xyz);\n",
    "- `current_order`: order stored internally to operate on the stack;\n",
    "- `output_order`: order of the desired output stack (default xyz);\n",
    "- `n_tilts`: number of tilt images in the stack;\n",
    "- `height` and `width`: Dimension of the images in the stack (i.e. number of pixels in X and Y dimension).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mdoc basics\n",
    "Internally, mdoc files are stored in the Mdoc class, which has 5 attributes designed to parse and store the information contained in mdocs, which can then be accessed programmatically. The attributes of the class are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `file_path`: Path of the mdoc file;\n",
    "- `titles`: List of general information about the session, for instance the microscope name, date of the session, the tilt-axis angle, spot size. These is stored in square brackets in the mdoc files before the metadata of each single image;\n",
    "- `project_info`: This is a disctionary that contains again general information stored in the header of the mdoc files. Keys and values will be automatically assigned. Typical keys are PixelSpacing, Voltage, ImageFile, ImageSize, DataMode.\n",
    "- `imgs`: This is dataframe with as many rows as the number of images in the stack and as many columns as the number of fields. The header of the dataframe corresponds with the names of the fields;\n",
    "- `section_id`: The image identifier inside the mdoc (e.g. ZValue)"

In case it is not, a useful first step is sorting the images by their tilt angle. This can be achived with the `sort_tilts_by_angle()` function in the `tiltstack` module. This function requires both the original stack and the angles information as input. As for the information on the angles, this can be provided either as an array or as the path to a file containng angle information. In the latter case, accepted formats are mdoc files of Warp xlm files. Alternatively, you can pass a text file with the angle information. Please refer to `ioutils.tlt_load()` for more information on the accepted formats. To work further with the sorted stack, it is a good idea to update the mdoc file as well. this can be accomplished with the `sort_mdoc_by_tilt_angles()` function of the `mdoc` module.
